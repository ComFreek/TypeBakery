# TypeBakery

## What's this?

I needed an event system for one of my projects, so I've created a class which implements `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()`.

I called this **TypeBakery** in the style of [CakePHP's Bakery](http://bakery.cakephp.org/), so the idea is to collect some great classes built on top of TypeScript.

## Unit testing

I've coded a simple unit testing suite. You can find it in the [UnitTest](https://github.com/ComFreek/TypeBakery/tree/master/UnitTest) subfolder.

## About
Idea: [@comfreek](http://twitter.com/comfreek)

Also take a look at my other project concerning TypeScript: [TSCompiler](https://github.com/ComFreek/TSCompiler).<br />
It aims to provide interfaces to the TypeScript compiler for multiple languages.
